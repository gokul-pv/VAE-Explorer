Assignment - Final - Task 1 - Segmentation
=================================

Please refer to ReadMe.txt for general rules for this final assignment.

In this task, you shall train a U-Net to segment images according to the 4 types of sportballs they can contain.

You shall use the provided code to generate your train and test data.
Keep the images small - 32 pixels - with a single object of one of the four categories with max size 24 pixels.
You can generate as many examples for the training set as you wish (10000 may be a good number).
You shall generate 1000 examples for the test set.
You will need to tweak the code in `data/sportballs.py` to create the segmentation labels automatically.
Each type of sportsball shall have a different segmentation label.

You shall implement and train U-Net like model adapting the architecture to the small images of 32x32 pixels.

You shall follow the instructions for the content of the report as explained in ReadMe.txt. 
In addition, you shall use the final trained versions to:
* Report the average Intersection Over Union (IOU) metric over the test set data
* Print 10 examples of original test images, their corresponding segmentation maps and the predicted segmentation maps.
