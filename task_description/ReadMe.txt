Assignment - Final
===============

In this assignment you shall pick and tackle one of 4 tasks below:

1. Segmentation
2. Generation via VAE
3. Generation via GAN
4. Classification

More detailed description of the tasks is available in the respective *.txt files.

The final assignment shall be submitted via E-learning by Sunday 14.7. 23:59.

The submission shall contain all your code and a report documenting, explaining and commenting your work.
The report can be a jupyter notebook, a markdown file, or any other format you consider fit.
It shall clarify the problem and challenges to be tackled, explain all important steps and decisions you have made, present and discuss the results of your experimentation, summarize the main outcomes, and conclude with a brief self-evaluation pointing to the particularly strong parts of your solution and reflecting on weaknesses and a possible areas for improvements.
Hint: The report does not have to be "fancy" (no need for irrelevant beatification). What matters is the content and clarity of presentation. It shall be well structured, have clear textual explanations and provide relevant and well formatted and presented graphics (images, graphs) to support your arguments.

You shall use the report as the support (walk us through it) in the final discussion on Monday-Tuesday 15.-16.7. as per your slot.
You will have 15 minutes (not longer, plan it well!) to present the report and we will follow by a 15 minute discussion.
If you are in a group of 2, you shall in the beginning briefly clarify how you organized the work (who has done what) and both of you shall speak during the presentation.
The discussion will focus on your work and can cover any related aspect - ranging from the theoretical background to the code implementation.
We will briefly inspect your code and you shall be able to clarify all details in it - random questions such as "can you please explain what line xxx does and why you need it" may come.

The final assignment is evaluated with 50 points (individually).
The evaluation will be based on the quality of your solution and your ability to explain and argue for your decisions.
The quality of the report, of your code implementation and of your presentation also contribute.
Hint: High accuracy of your model can help your arguments but is definitely not the most important criteria. Far more important is your understanding of the model and its behavior. In brief, I am not interested in your ability to copy-paste a fancy complex model from somewhere, I am interested to see that you are able to develop your own model with reasonably good performance following all the considerations discussed in the course.
